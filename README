= Chit

Chit is a command line cheat sheet tool, which was inspired by 'cheat' (http://cheat.errtheblog.com/) by Chris Wanstrath. 

There are several differences between 'cheat' and 'chit'. By using chit, besides the wonderful features of 'cheat', you get:

1. Git powered cheat sheet repository. You can specify where you get the sheets and where to share them. 
2. You can have your own private cheat sheet. Everybody has some project related or smoe cheat sheets which are not mean to public. You can also put them into chit
3. Directory support. You can group cheat sheets by directory now.

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install chit
